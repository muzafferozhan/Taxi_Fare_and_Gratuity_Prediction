# Taxi Fare and Gratuity Prediction

This project is based on a workplace scenario, where NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission contracted my company for building predictive models to provide estimated fares before the journey commences.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Overview and Description

- The purpose of this project is to design a Multiple Linear regression model for taxi fare amount prediction and a machine learning model that provides predictions on whether a customer will be a generous tipper.

- The project started with initial inspection and EDA, followed by identification of key variables for modelling that were later restructured as part of feature engineering. 

- The models built were then fit to the training data and their performance was checked using test data.

- Key deliverables from each step are provided in the executive summary reports provided in this repository.

- The jupyter notebook provided is a walk-through of the whole project with step-by-step explanations, codes and their outputs.

- Dataset used for the project is a sample drawn from TLC's 113 millions-row data.

- Full dataset is available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs
